<h1>The Rationale for DDD </h1>
<h2>Excessive Incidental Complexity</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>The testing ice cream cone is a classic case of what Fred Brooks calls incidental complexity in his seminal paper titled No Silver Bullet — Essence and Accident in Software Engineering </li>
  <li>However, incidental or accidental complexity is not directly attributable to the problem itself — but is caused by limitations of the people involved, their skill levels, the tools and/or abstractions being used</li>
 </ul> 

<h2>Uncontrolled Technical Debt</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>Technical debt is what results when development teams take arguably sub-optimal actions to expedite the delivery of a set of features or projects. For a period of time, just like borrowed money allows you to do things sooner than you could otherwise, technical debt can result in short term speed</li>
   <li>value- adding functional features, can lead to unusable systems — and subsequently failure.</li>
 </ul>


<h1>Modern Systems and dealing with complexity</h1>
<h2>How software get built</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before we express a solution in working code, it is necessary to understand what the problem entails, why the problem is important to solve, and finally, how it can be solved.</li>
<li>The delivery pipeline enables us to put software in the hands of our customers, whereas the feedback pipeline allows us to adjust and adapt. As we can see, this is a continuum. And if we are to build better, more valuable software, this continuum, this potentially infinite loop has to be optimized!</li>
</ul>
